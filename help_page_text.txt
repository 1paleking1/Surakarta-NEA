Surakarta is a two-player turn-based strategy board game originating from Indonesia. The game is played at the Mind Sports Olympiad which is a board game competition.
Each player has two rows of six pieces and the aim of the game is to capture all the opponent's pieces. A player will always have a legal move so games cannot end in a stalemate. The 6x6 board contains inner and outer looped tracks, circling around the game board which are used to capture pieces. To capture a piece, a piece moves along the inner or outer track around one or more of the four board loops until it lands on an opposing piece and replaces it. During this path to capture, the capturing piece cannot encounter any of its own pieces before it meets an opponent piece. In other words, for a capture to be legal no pieces can be in-between the capturing piece and the piece being captured. Captures can only be made by making this skating manoeuvre around the board. Below is an image of the board in its starting position.
